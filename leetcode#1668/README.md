## Maximum Repeating Substring
For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.

Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.


### Example 1:

> Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
>
> Output: 2

### Example 2:

> Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"
>
> Output: 1

### Example 3:

> Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"
>
> Output: 0


### Constraints:

- 1 <= sequence.length <= 100
- 1 <= word.length <= 100
- sequence and word contains only lowercase English letters.
