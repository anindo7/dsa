## Longest Repeating Character Replacement
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
### Example 1:

> Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
>
> Output: 4

### Example 2:

> Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
>
> Output: 4


### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of only uppercase English letters.
- 0 <= k <= s.length
